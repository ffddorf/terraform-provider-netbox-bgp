This provider allows managing BGP resources in Netbox, when the [Netbox BGP plugin](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-bgp) is installed.

The provider is intentionally using a similar structure to the [`e-breuninger/netbox`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/e-breuninger/netbox/latest) provider. If you're already using that provider, this provider should work smoothly alongside it.
